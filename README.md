<h2>About the Magento 2 RMA Extension</h2>
                        <ul>
                        <p>
Returned goods are a growing problem for online retailers. It’s hard to keep track of who has returned what, and it can be frustrating trying to manage all the returns. 
</p>
<p>
 But many of your customers don’t know how to return their orders properly, and this leads to delays in processing returns. Some even try returning items without any packaging at all! This is troublesome for both you and the customer as it can delay the refund process significantly.
</p>
<p>
 With this Return Order & RMA Extension, you can make sure that every customer has an optimal experience when they choose to return or exchange products purchased from your store. It allows shoppers who have received defective products or simply changed their minds about what they bought on your eCommerce site to submit a request through our simple interface.
</p>
<p>
The Magento 2 Return Order & RMA Extension makes it easy for your customers to request a return, including returning merchandise without shipping labels, printing their own shipping label from home or work printer, tracking of returned items on your website, refunding money via credit card payment system (PayPal), offline payment, store credit, gift card, and in-store payment. 
</p>
<p>
We provide your customers with a label and a tracking number to ease the process for them and for your customer service team.

<h2 style="font-weight: 600;">MAGENTO 2 ORDERS AND RETURNS EXTENSION</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
 Instead of simply canceling unsatisfactory orders that are returned, many online stores take a few different strategies for increased customer satisfaction. For 30% to 50% during holiday or promotional seasons, this can mean an increase in customer service.
</p>
<p>
Customers might purchase several items intending to return some or realize they are unhappy with their purchase. However, at the end of the day, it becomes your responsibility to handle returns.
</p>
<p>
Stats show that:
</p>
<p>
- Around 40% of customers who buy multiple sizes or variations of a product choose to return their items to one of our nearby store locations. A hassle-free eCommerce return process is good for both customer delight and cost savings.
</p>
<p>
 - 75% of returns come from repeat customers. Give your customers control to manage their own return process and encourage them to visit other store locations.
</p>
<p>
 - The return process for online purchases can be frustrating, and 90 percent of shoppers have returned items they’ve purchased. As an online store owner, meeting customer expectations is one way to keep them happy and coming back again in the future.
</p>
<p>
- As many as 80% of e-commerce shoppers will leave a store after encountering difficulties. Reduce customer friction and simplify the return process with powerful RMA systems software for more satisfied customers!
</p>
<p>
Without a strong return strategy and a flexible Magento 2 Returns Extension in place, your company will need to hire more employees. Hiring new employees increases the number of departments that must process returns. To retrieve returned items from inventory sooner, you may also need to set aside more space for storing them or consider other options like drop-shipping.
</p>
<p>
Currently, companies take an average of 14 days to process a return. But it's not just the wait -- often they make it difficult for people who have already provided their order information or payment details.
</p>
<p>
As such, many businesses require repeat forms of an order number or financial data that customers have already given them
</p>
<p>
The downside to blind returns is not just the cost. This can result in unorganized inventory, unhappy customers, and prolonged customer service conversations. Without proper Return tracking, a process that should take seconds will turn into days or weeks of phone calls with unsatisfied consumers.
</p>
<p>
When customers return items they've already purchased, you're left with boxes that have been poorly labeled and unpacked. That's why it is important that both the customer and your company understand the refund status and amount of returns coming back.
</p>
<p>
 Another look at statistics shows that:
</p>
<p>
 -67% of customers will look at your return policy before buying a product or service from you.
</p>
<p>
-Returning an order is one of the most challenging parts for customers, but 58% are not satisfied with the current process. We have created a Return Merchandise Authorization RMA solution that will allow orders to be easily returned.
</p>
<p>
-72% of shoppers said they would spend more money with a company if the return experience was easy.
</p>
<p>
Without appropriate eCommerce returns management, companies are often left with a few potential solutions to the returned goods problem. They may choose to store returns in an out-of-the-way area of their warehouse, deem them as miscellaneous inventory when they do physical counts.
</p>
<p>
This may not be an appropriate option for products that are based on seasonal trends or in high demand at any given time. For example, a fashion shoe that has just recently been introduced to the market and which quickly becomes popular due to its stylish design.
</p>
<p>
Studies show that 10% of the supply chain cost is set aside for return and repair processes, which can be insufficient. However, if there are systematic gaps in software and processes to optimize returns then a 30% loss could result.
</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t a Magento returns module be the best thing you could invest in? What else puts you ahead of eCommerce returning best practices, while lessening your workload? A streamlined return process will make it less challenging and result in better profits.

<h2>THE WARDROBER.</h2>

<h2>THE FITTING ROOMER.</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
This customer replicates the in-store experience of trying on multiple sizes or colors of an article. They're just getting to the dressing room. Sure, they will make their selection when they reach it, but you can probably anticipate that the rest are going right back with them.
  </p>
  <p>
Amazon’s “Prime Wardrobe” section has contributed to a rise in this behavior as it encourages consumers to return more. This behavior makes a return policy imperative for eCommerce websites. Segmenting your customers on their "return likelihood" is important, as it allows you to be flexible with your customer retention strategies.
  </p>
  <p>
For example, you could offer a free return for consumers with a low likelihood of purchasing your product. This helps you avoid the cost of shipping products back to the warehouse. Also, if there is a high likelihood that someone will buy your product and something else in your catalog, they could receive an alternative offer from you.
  </p>
  <p>
A good product page is crucial for improving customer experience and increasing conversion rates. But after the sale, you have more work to do!
  </p>
  <p>
Reduce your logistical burden with our Magento 2 Return Merchandise Authorization module. Create a simple, transparent, generous, and approachable returns process that will result in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Customers often get frustrated when they return a product. They don't know if it's been received, processed or if their refund has been issued.
</p>
<p>

<h2>MAKE RETURNS A PRIORITY!</h2>

</p>

<h2>USE SMART RETURN RULES TO PROTECT PROFIT MARGINS.</h2>
<p><img src="https://wesupplylabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/5-min-2.png"></p>
<ul>
  <p>
Returns are expensive and time-consuming.
  </p>
  <p>
Customers who purchase discounted items are more likely to return the item.
</p>
<p>
 You can lose a lot of money by having too many returns on sale items, especially during event seasons like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
</p>
<p>
 The Magento 2 RMA Requests extension allows you to create a customized return policy for every individual customer. Save time and money by limiting returns on discounted items during event seasons.
</p>
<p>
With the use of smart return rules, you can now set different return policies based on product type, price, or sale status. You may also choose to automatically accept certain products that have been purchased in the past without any issues or problems. This will allow your customers to exchange their purchases with ease even if they're not sure about their choices at first glance!
</p>
<p>
Retailers of items that can have a high resale value are able to replenish their inventories with returned items. For example, stores selling limited edition sneakers or clothing on which people buy just to resell.
</p>
<p>
This is specific for fashion retailers who may deal in items for which customers will purchase without the intention of keeping them.
</p>
<p>
The hype around a product can dissipate and people may not buy it for the desired amount. Plus, if there is something wrong with it, the customer will often return it to get their money back.
</p>
<p>
Mystery Boxes are often excluded from a return as they include random items which can come out of season or before their due date. The goal of these boxes is to sell various products to customers who may otherwise not be interested in the store's offerings.
</p>
<p>
Some retailers refuse to accept returns on such items or provide store credit refunds. But with the help of a streamlined return process, you will be able to stay ahead of customer needs this peak season more easily. This attention to the overall customer experience during the busiest time ensures that all customers regardless of circumstance get better attention.
</p>
<p>
 To provide your customers with a more streamlined experience, you should create easy-to-follow tracking, notification, and returns procedures.

<h2>TURN RETURNS INTO NEW ORDERS WITH MARKETING ASSISTS & PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS.</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
   Returns are an inevitable part of e-commerce. 
  </p>
  <p>
They represent lost revenue and can be a huge inconvenience to your customer.
</p>
<p>
 Engage with customers after the return has been processed, and turn returns into new orders! Use this opportunity to upsell alternative products or introduce new promotions, sales, and campaigns! The product recommendation engine can help you make an upsell to a customer’s previous purchase, leaving them feeling totally satisfied. This while retaining loyalty to your brand.

<h2>STORE CREDIT AND GIFT CARD FOR REFUNDS.</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
 If you’re a retailer, you know that it can be hard to get people to return their items. You might even have had customers who don’t want anything in exchange for their item – they just want the refund.
  </p>
  <p>
But what if you could give them something else? Something of value? Something that will make them come back and shop with your store again and again? 
<p>
The solution is simple - offer an instant gift card generator or store credit instead of forcing your customer to wait around while their refunds are processed. By giving them this option, they’ll feel like they got something out of returning the item! It doesn't take any longer than processing a refund would, but gives customers more options so they can continue shopping right away!

<ul>
  <p>
There are many factors that play into why customers choose to return their products, and it’s important for companies to understand these reasons in order to effectively improve their customer service.
  </p>
  <p>
 In the holiday season alone, returns are likely going to increase by at least 20% over your average rate of return! This is a crucial time for companies to gather data and make improvements before they lose more money than necessary on unreturned goods.
<p>
We offer multiple data points that help you analyze your current situation so you can optimize your policy, processes, and logistics around returns! By understanding what drives customers away from purchasing from you again (and how much), you can make important decisions to improve your services.

Step 1:
Before installing the <a href="https://support.wesupplylabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037959632-Magento-2-Extension">Magento 2 RMA Extension Free Trial</a></h3>, please check the extension compatibility. This extension is currently compatible with the following Magento versions: 2.0.X. - 2.4.x. It’s recommended to install the extension on a dev server before installing it on a live (production) server.
</p>
<p>
Step 2:
Copy the extension files to below paths of your magento 2 instance. If ‘app/code/WeSupply’ folder is missing, please create it manually:
app/code/WeSupply/Toolbox
</p>
<p>
Step 3:
Access the root of your magento 2 project from command line and run the following commands:
 <p>
      <strong>php bin/magento module:enable WeSupply_Toolbox --clear-static-content</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>php bin/magento setup:upgrade</strong>
</p>

<h2>HOW TO UPGRADE THE EXTENSION.</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
    Step 1: Remove extension code under app/code/WeSupply/Toolbox before adding the new extension files. The extension may be refactored and old unused files may cause random issues so it's best to only keep the latest version of the files.
